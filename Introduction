The Network Security module was designed to provide me with a comprehensive understanding of the key principles and practices in the field of network security. This course covered essential topics such as the architecture and protocols of computer networks, and the techniques used to secure these networks against various threats.

I learned about different types of network attacks, including eavesdropping, spoofing, and denial-of-service attacks, and how to identify and mitigate these threats. The module also introduced the concept of network defense mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and network monitoring tools.

A significant portion of the course focused on encryption and secure communication methods. I studied various encryption protocols, such as SSL/TLS and IPSec, and how they are used to protect data in transit. Additionally, I explored virtual private networks (VPNs) and how they provide secure remote access to network resources.

The module also emphasized the importance of network security policies and governance. I learned about the development and implementation of security policies, network access control mechanisms, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Practical exercises and case studies helped me apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing me to design and manage secure networks effectively.
